When you’re working with AWS Lambda at scale, you eventually hit limits you didn’t expect.  
For us, it happened when we tried to deploy a new function and got this error:

```
An error occurred: HelloLambdaFunction - Code storage limit exceeded. (Service: AWSLambda; Status Code: 400; Error Code: CodeStorageExceededException; Request ID: ...)
```

At first glance, you might think this means the **account-wide Lambda code storage quota** (75 GB) had been hit.  
But in reality, this was about the **deployment package size limit**:

- **Uncompressed package size limit**: 250 MB (.zip or .jar)  
- **Compressed zip size (direct upload)**: 50 MB  
- If uploaded via S3: up to **250 MB uncompressed**  

We weren’t over 75 GB — instead, our **per-function package (code + dependencies) had simply grown too large**.

## The Problem: Duplicate Dependencies Everywhere

As we investigated, we realized the issue wasn’t the business logic itself — it was the **dependencies**.  

Every Lambda function in our stack was bundling the **same libraries** (e.g., AWS SDK, utilities, common packages). This duplication caused our deployment packages to balloon past the 250 MB limit.

## The Solution: Lambda Layers

Enter **Lambda Layers**.  

Instead of packaging the same dependencies into each Lambda, we created a **shared layer** that contained all the common packages.  

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Reduced package size** — each Lambda only carries its business logic.  
- ✅ **Single point of update** — updating a dependency in the Layer automatically applies to all Lambdas that use it.  
- ✅ **No duplication** — shared libraries live in the Layer instead of being bundled repeatedly.

## Alternatives (If Layers Aren’t Enough)

While Lambda Layers solved our issue, there are other approaches too:

1. **Container Image Lambdas**  
   - Build your Lambda as a Docker image and push it to **ECR**.  
   - Supports images up to **10 GB** (much bigger than 250 MB zips).  
   - Great for heavy workloads (ML, data processing).  

2. **Trim Dependencies**  
   - Audit your code — sometimes we include entire libraries when we only need a subset.  

3. **Multiple Layers**  
   - Each Lambda can use up to **5 layers**, with each compressed layer up to **50 MB**.  
   - Helpful if one layer starts getting too large.

## Why Lambda Layers Made Life Easier

The biggest win? **Maintaining dependencies**.

Instead of updating packages in every single Lambda one by one (and redeploying each time), we just update the dependency in the **Lambda Layer**.  
- Security vulnerability in `lodash`? Fix it once in the Layer → all Lambdas pick up the update.  
- New version of `aws-sdk`? Update it once → instantly applied everywhere.  

This not only saves time but also ensures consistency across our stack. Every Lambda is always running with the same dependency versions, reducing drift and hidden bugs.


## Final Thoughts

By moving to Lambda Layers, we eliminated duplicate code, reduced package sizes, and simplified dependency management.  

The scary `CodeStorageExceededException` turned out to be less about hitting AWS’s global quota — and more about us packaging too much into each function.  

Layers not only fixed the error but also made our architecture **leaner and easier to maintain**.

Have you hit the same **250 MB Lambda package size wall**?  
If so, did you solve it with **Layers**, **container images**, or another trick? I’d love to hear your approach!
