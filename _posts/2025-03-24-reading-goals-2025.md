Every year, I tell myself I'll read more books, and every year... well, life happens. But 2025? This is the year I finally get through my reading list! Here's what I'm aiming forâ€”some mind-expanding non-fiction and some fiction to get lost in. 

## Non-Fiction ðŸ“–

These books will (hopefully) make me think differently, build better habits, and maybe even change my life a little:

- [ ] *The Way of the Superior Man* â€“ A guide to mastering work, relationships, and life.
- [ ] *Can't Hurt Me* â€“ David Goggins' insane life story + mental toughness lessons.
- [ ] *Into the Wild* â€“ A deep dive into adventure, freedom, and the risks of chasing dreams.
- [ ] *Digital Minimalism* â€“ Because my screen time report is embarrassing.
- [ ] *Thinking, Fast and Slow* â€“ A classic on how we make decisions (and why we get them wrong).
- [ ] *Educated* â€“ A memoir about resilience, education, and breaking free from the past.
- [ ] *Atomic Habits* â€“ Everyone says this book is life-changing. Time to see what the hype is about.

## Fiction ðŸŽ­

Gotta balance all that heavy thinking with some great stories:

- [ ] *Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow* â€“ A book about gaming, friendship, and ambition.
- [ ] *The Secret of the Nagas* & *The Oath of the Vayuputras* â€“ Mythology meets action-packed storytelling.
- [ ] *Malibu Rising* â€“ A summer read full of drama, family, and secrets.
- [ ] *A Thousand Splendid Suns* â€“ An emotional story that I know will leave an impact.
- [ ] *Daisy Jones & The Six* â€“ Rock & roll and behind-the-scenes band drama? I'm in.
- [ ] *Local Woman Missing* â€“ Thriller time!
- [ ] *Salemâ€™s Lot* â€“ Because I need more Stephen King in my life.
- [ ] *The Boyfriend* â€“ A mysterious romance with twists (I hope).
- [ ] *I Let You Go* â€“ A psychological thriller thatâ€™s supposed to be unputdownable.
- [ ] *First Lie Wins* â€“ Another thriller because I love a good plot twist.
- [ ] *Today Tonight Tomorrow* â€“ A cute enemies-to-lovers romance.
- [ ] *Death on the Nile* â€“ Classic Agatha Christie detective goodness.

I have no idea if I'll actually get through all of these, but hey, gotta aim high! If youâ€™ve read any of these, let me know what you thinkâ€”or suggest something I *must* add to the list. Happy reading! ðŸ“šâœ¨
