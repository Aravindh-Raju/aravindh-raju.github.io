Every year, I start with good intentions.  
New goals. New plans. A fresh sense of motivation.

And then reality kicks in.

Work gets busy. Energy dips. Some days I just don’t feel like doing anything extra. Over time, I’ve realized the problem was never about setting goals. It was about how I approached them and what I expected from myself.

This year, I’m trying to be more honest. Less idealistic. More realistic.

## What I’ve Learned About Goals (the Hard Way)

I used to think goals had to be big and aggressive to matter. If they didn’t scare me a little, I felt like I wasn’t aiming high enough.

That mindset usually led to burnout or quiet guilt when I couldn’t keep up.

Now, I see goals more as **direction**, not pressure. Something to guide my days, not judge them.

## Breaking Things Down Made Everything Easier

Big goals sound great on paper. Living with them every day is another story.

“Master DSA” or “get fit” feels motivating for about a week. After that, it just feels heavy.

What helped was breaking everything down into actions I could realistically repeat:
- Not “get fit”, but going to the gym four times a week
- Not “learn system design”, but reading one technical blog a day
- Not “get certified”, but showing up for one focused hour daily

Once I stopped chasing intensity and started chasing consistency, things felt manageable again.

## Consistency Over Motivation

I don’t trust motivation anymore. It comes and goes.

What actually works for me is having small, non-negotiable actions. Solving two DSA problems a day doesn’t feel impressive. But I know that over time, it adds up in a way that random bursts of effort never did.

Some days will be productive. Some days will be average. I’m learning to be okay with that.

## When I Feel Like Giving Up

There are days when I don’t want to continue. When progress feels invisible.

Two things help me on those days.

First, rewards. Not big ones. Just small reminders that effort deserves appreciation. A break. A good meal. A quiet evening without guilt.

Second, visualization. I remind myself why I started. Not the goal itself, but the version of me that sticks with it even when it’s boring.

That usually brings me back.

## My Goals for 2026

These are the goals I’m committing to this year. I’m writing them down not to pressure myself, but to stay aligned.

### Career and Learning
- **AWS Certified Generative AI Developer – Professional**  
  I plan to dedicate **at least one focused hour every day** toward preparation  
- **DSA mastery** by solving **two problems every day**  
- **System design mastery** by reading **one technical system design blog daily**

### Health and Mind
- **Maintain a physically fit body** by hitting the **gym four times a week**  
- Improve mental stability through **meditation and spirituality**

### Life and Experiences
- Complete **two trips**, with at least **one international**  
- Read **10 books** across different genres  

There’s also **one secret goal** I’m keeping to myself.  
I’m not writing it here yet. If it happens, it’ll speak for itself.

## Final Thoughts

I don’t expect perfection this year. I expect effort.

If I miss a day, I’ll resume.  
If I slow down, I’ll keep moving.  
If things get hard, I’ll adjust instead of quitting.

That’s the plan. Simple, honest, and sustainable.

## Over to You

What are you working toward this year?  
Not the flashy version. The real one.

And what’s the one small thing you know you can show up for, even on bad days?
